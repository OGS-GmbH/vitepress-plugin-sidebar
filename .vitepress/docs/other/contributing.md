# Contributing

## Guideline

Contributions are always welcome and greatly appreciated. Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature, or improve the documentation, your input helps make the project better for everyone.

If you're unsure where to start, check the open issues for guidance. Even small contributions, such as fixing typos or improving code readability, are valuable.

Feel free to submit a pull request or start a discussion — we're happy to collaborate!
